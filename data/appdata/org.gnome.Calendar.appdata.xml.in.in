  <summary>Manage your schedule</summary>

  <description>
    <p>
      GNOME Calendar is an elegant tool to help you plan and stay on top of your schedule for
      upcoming days and weeks, whether your months are filled with meetings and appointments,
      public events, travel logistics, or other commitments in your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Easily create and manage unlimited calendars and events with GNOME Calendar's infinite
      scrolling month view, week timetable, and scheduling list view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Integrating the latest GNOME technologies and design best practices, GNOME Calendar builds on
      top of the mature Evolution data server to manage large quantities of events and to provide
      integration with other applications. You can add calendars from various online calendaring
      services (like NextCloud, Google Calendar, and CalDAV / WebDAV servers), enabling you to
      synchronize your events across multiple devices and platforms. GNOME Calendar also supports
      local and offline calendaring, so you can use it anywhere and anytime while travelling
      (or after civilization's collapse.)
