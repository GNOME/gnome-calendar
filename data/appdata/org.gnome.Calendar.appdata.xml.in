    <p>
      GNOME Calendar is a simple and beautiful calendar application designed to perfectly fit the GNOME
      desktop. By reusing the components which the GNOME desktop is built on, Calendar nicely integrates
      with the GNOME ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aim to find the perfect balance between nicely crafted features and user-centred usability. No
      excess, no lacks. You’ll feel comfortable using Calendar, like you’ve been using it for ages!
