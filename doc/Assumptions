# Some words about how do we work so far #

1. We load calendar sources from Online Accounts, and the default sources.
   (So we'll need a view for adding sources)

2. Using sexp for getting objects between two dates:
   (occur-in-time-range? (make-time "20001116T230000Z") (make-time "20001217T230000Z") "America/Havana")

3. We'll merge all the description from `e_cal_component_get_description_list`
   into one big description for an event. Actually the thing is for now we'll just handle E_CAL_COMPONENT_EVENT
   any other VType will cause unknown behavior

4. I've done a lot of simplication from what the API of e-d-s offers to how we
   show alarms of events. The code is marked with comments inside GcalManager.
   Among other stuff we'll show only reminders set before the event, and just
   before the start time of the event.

5. All-day events are those that fall under one of these conditions:
   - Both, start date and end date are marked with is_date, so doesn't have time specified
